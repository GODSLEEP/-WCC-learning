**1. Integer to Binary Conversion using Recursion:**

**Algorithm:**
1. Base Case: If the integer is 0, return an empty string.
2. Recursive Case: Divide the integer by 2 and call the function recursively with the quotient.
3. Concatenate the remainder of division with the result of the recursive call.
4. Return the concatenated string.

**Pseudo-code:**

```
Function IntegerToBinary(integer):
    if integer == 0:
        return ""
    else:
        return IntegerToBinary(integer / 2) + (integer % 2)
```

**2. Least Common Denominator (LCD) using Recursion:**

**Algorithm:**
1. Base Case: If the denominator is 0, return the numerator.
2. Recursive Case: Call the function recursively with the denominator and the remainder of dividing the numerator by the denominator.
3. Return the result of the recursive call.

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Function find_lcd(numerator, denominator):
    if denominator == 0:
        return numerator
    else:
        return find_lcd(denominator, numerator % denominator)
```

**3. Exponentiation using Recursion:**

**Algorithm:**
1. Base Case: If the exponent is 0, return 1.
2. Recursive Case: Call the function recursively with the same base and exponent - 1.
3. Multiply the base with the result of the recursive call.
4. Return the result.

**Pseudo-code:**

```
Function power(x, e):
    if e == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return x * power(x, e - 1)
```

**1. Implementing Integer to Binary Conversion using Iteration:**

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation.
2. Iterate while the integer is greater than 0.
3. At each iteration, find the remainder of dividing the integer by 2 (this gives the current binary digit).
4. Concatenate the binary digit with the binary string.
5. Update the integer by performing integer division by 2 (to shift bits to the right).
6. Repeat until the integer becomes 0.
7. Return the binary string.

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Function IntegerToBinary(integer):
    binary_string = ""
    while integer > 0:
        binary_string = (integer % 2) + binary_string
        integer = integer // 2
    return binary_string
```

**2. Implementing Least Common Denominator (LCD) using Iteration:**

**Algorithm:**

1. Start with a while loop that continues until the denominator becomes 0.
2. Within each iteration, swap the numerator and denominator such that the remainder of numerator divided by denominator becomes the new numerator.
3. Update the denominator to be the remainder of the previous numerator and denominator.
4. Repeat this process until the denominator becomes 0.
5. Return the last non-zero numerator, which is the least common denominator.

**Pseudo-code:**

```
Function find_lcd(numerator, denominator):
    while denominator != 0:
        numerator, denominator = denominator, numerator % denominator
    return numerator
```

**3. Implementing Exponentiation using Iteration:**

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the result of exponentiation.
2. Start a while loop that continues until the exponent becomes 0.
3. Within each iteration, multiply the current result by the base.
4. Decrement the exponent by 1 in each iteration to progress towards the base case.
5. Repeat this process until the exponent becomes 0.
6. Return the final result after all iterations, which represents the exponentiation of the base raised to the given exponent.

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Function power(x, e):
    result = 1
    while e > 0:
        result *= x
        e -= 1
    return result
```

**Comparison between Recursion and Iteration:**

Recursion and iteration both have their pros and cons in terms of efficiency and readability. Recursion can lead to more elegant and concise solutions, but it might suffer from stack overflow errors for very large inputs. Iteration, on the other hand, typically consumes less memory and may be faster in execution for certain problems.

For the provided problems, implementing them using iteration can be straightforward by utilizing loops instead of recursive function calls. The efficiency of each approach can be evaluated by analyzing their time complexity and space complexity.

**Efficiency Comparison:**
1. **Integer to Binary Conversion:**
   - Recursion: Time - O(log n), Space - O(log n) (due to recursion stack)
   - Iteration: Time - O(log n), Space - O(1)

2. **Least Common Denominator (LCD):**
   - Recursion: Time - O(log n), Space - O(log n) (due to recursion stack)
   - Iteration: Time - O(log n), Space - O(1)

3. **Exponentiation:**
   - Recursion: Time - O(e), Space - O(e) (due to recursion stack)
   - Iteration: Time - O(e), Space - O(1)

**Conclusion:**
- Recursion often leads to more elegant and concise code but may consume more memory due to recursion stack.
- Iteration tends to be more efficient in terms of memory usage and may be faster for certain problems.
- The choice between recursion and iteration depends on factors such as problem complexity, input size, and memory constraints.
