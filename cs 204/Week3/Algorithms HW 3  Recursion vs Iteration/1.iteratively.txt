function linearSearchIterative(array, target):
    for i from 0 to length(array) - 1:
        if array[i] equals target:
            return i
    return -1  // Target not found

Comments:

This iterative approach uses a loop to iterate through each element of the array.
It checks if the current element is equal to the target.
If a match is found, it returns the index of the target; otherwise, it returns -1 indicating that the target is not present in the array.
