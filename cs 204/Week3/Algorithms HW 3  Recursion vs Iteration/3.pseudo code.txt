function binarySearchRecursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  // Target not found

    mid = (left + right) // 2

    if arr[mid] equals target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] less than target:
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
    else:
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)

Comments:

The recursive binary search is implemented by passing left and right boundaries as parameters.
If the left boundary is greater than the right boundary, it means the target is not found, and -1 is returned.
Calculate the middle index and check if the element at that index is equal to the target.
If the middle element is less than the target, recursively search in the right half; otherwise, recursively search in the left half.
