function linearSearchRecursive(array, target, index):
    if index equals length(array):
        return -1  // Target not found
    else if array[index] equals target:
        return index
    else:
        return linearSearchRecursive(array, target, index + 1)

Comments:

The recursive approach checks if the current index is equal to the length of the array; if true, it means the target is not found, and -1 is returned.
If the current element at the given index is equal to the target, the index is returned.
Otherwise, the function calls itself with the next index.
