### Selection Sort:
- **Best Case:** O(n^2) - Even if the array is sorted, the algorithm still needs to perform the same number of comparisons and swaps as in the worst case.
- **Average Case:** O(n^2) - In the average case, selection sort performs the same number of comparisons and swaps as in the worst case.
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2) - The algorithm always makes roughly n^2/2 comparisons and n swaps, where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Insertion Sort:
- **Best Case:** O(n) - If the array is already nearly sorted or partially sorted, insertion sort can have a linear time complexity. Each element is compared to only a few elements before finding its correct position.
- **Average Case:** O(n^2) - In the average case, insertion sort makes roughly n^2/4 comparisons and n^2/4 swaps.
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2) - Similar to the average case, insertion sort has quadratic time complexity in the worst case.

### Comparison:

- **Best Case Comparison:**
  - Selection Sort: In the best case, selection sort doesn't benefit from the array being partially sorted. It still needs to perform the same number of comparisons and swaps as in the worst case.
  - Insertion Sort: In the best case, insertion sort benefits from the array being nearly sorted, resulting in a linear time complexity.

- **Average and Worst Case Comparison:**
  - Both selection sort and insertion sort have quadratic time complexities on average and in the worst case. They perform similarly in scenarios where the array is randomly ordered.
